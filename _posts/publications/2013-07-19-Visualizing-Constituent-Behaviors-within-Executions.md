abstract: ["In this New Ideas and Emerging Results paper, we
present a novel visualization, THE BRAIN, that reveals clusters
of source code that co-execute to produce behavioral features
of the program throughout and within executions. We created a
clustered visualization of source-code that is informed by dynamic
control flow of multiple executions; each cluster represents
commonly interacting logic that composes software features. In
addition, we render individual executions atop the clustered
multiple-execution visualization as user-controlled animations to
reveal characteristics of specific executionsâ€”these animations
may provide exemplars for the clustered features and provide
chronology for those behavioral features, or they may reveal
anomalous behaviors that do not fit with the overall operational
profile of most executions. Both the clustered multiple-execution
view and the animated individual-execution view provide insights
for the constituent behaviors within executions that compose
behaviors of whole executions. Inspired by neural imaging of
human brains of people who were subjected to various external
stimuli, we designed and implemented THE BRAIN to reveal
program activity during execution. The result has revealed
the principal behaviors of execution, and those behaviors were
revealed to be (in some cases) cohesive, modular source-code
structures and (in other cases) cross-cutting, emergent behaviors
that involve multiple modules. In this paper, we describe THE BRAIN and envisage the uses to which it can be put, and we
provide two example usage scenarios to demonstrate its utility."]
