ASE 2014 was personally a great experience! I presented an early research idea and got some great feedback for it! I was able to meet some leading thinkers in the area of software research, who have inspired my own research. Overall, it turned out to be a great learning experience.

The paper and the slides of my talk can be found [here]({{ site.url }}/publications/ase14_palepu_jones.pdf) and [here]({{ site.url }}/slides/ase14.pdf) respectively; along with a vimeo of my talk:
