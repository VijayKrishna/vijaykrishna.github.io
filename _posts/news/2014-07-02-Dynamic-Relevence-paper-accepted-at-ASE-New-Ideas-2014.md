Our paper titled: "Discriminating Influences among Instructions in a Dynamic Slice", was accepted as a New Ideas paper at [ASE 2014](http://ase2014.org/)! This paper describes early work on a technique that quantifies the relevance of each instruction-execution event within a dynamic slice, in an effort to provide richer interpretations of software program executions.
