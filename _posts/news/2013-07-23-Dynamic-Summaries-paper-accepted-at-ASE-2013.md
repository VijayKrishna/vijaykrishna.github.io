My paper with Prof. Xu and Prof Jones, titled: "Improving Efficiency of Dynamic Analysis with Dynamic Dependence Summaries", was accepted at the technical research track at [ASE 2013](http://ase2013.org/)! This work describes a novel technique to summarize the API method behavior in terms of the dynamic dependence relations observed therein.
