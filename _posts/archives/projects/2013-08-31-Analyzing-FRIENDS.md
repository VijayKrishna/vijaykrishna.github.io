This is a product of being a big fan of F.R.I.E.N.D.S. and a software engineer. :) I want to see if i can find something interesting by running some basic text analysis and statistics on the transcripts of the episodes.

questions that i am trying to answer:  
- Who speaks the most? 
- Summaries of individual episodes? 
- Summaries of what each F.R.I.E.N.D.S. said?
