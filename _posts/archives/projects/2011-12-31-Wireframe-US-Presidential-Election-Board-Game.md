Developed wireframe of a web based user interface of an existing board game based on the U.S. Presidential Elections as a part of a 6 man team. Conducted Cognitive Walkthroughs and Heuristic Evaluations for the wireframes developed. The scope of the wireframes was limited to the first two phases, i.e. the Primaries and Conventions.  

The objective of the project was to take the first steps in designing the user interface of a Web based game version of an existing US presidential elections board game created by Jean-Claude Falmagne.
