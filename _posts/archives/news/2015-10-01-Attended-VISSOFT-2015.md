VISSFOT 2015 was held in Bremen, Germany this year and it turned out to be an interesting time there for me! I presented two works around novel visualizations and software research, and got some great appreciation and feedback for it! Despite being a young community, I found the conference engaging and I am evermore enthusiastic about the role of visualizations in the area of software engineering and research.

The two papers on Cerebro and Spider SENSE, can be found [here]({{ site.url }}/publications/vissoft15_palepu_jones.pdf) and [here]({{ site.url }}/publications/vissoft15_reddy_etal.pdf) respectively.

*As I participated (far right) in a panel discussion on visualizing software runtime after my talk on Cerebro:*

And like with every conference, I do like to take a walk around a foreign town. :)

*The architecture in Bremen's old town is beautiful:*

*And the Cathedral in Bremen, Germany ... is breathtaking:*
