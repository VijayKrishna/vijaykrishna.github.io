Yet another ICSE! This time at San Fransisco! A lot of interesting research this time around. I think ICSE lived up to its reputation much better this time (as against last year). But maybe thats just me. Two papers that i thought were really interesting: [http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2486835](http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2486835) and [http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2486805](http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2486835). And oh yes, excellent banquet + cruise! :)
