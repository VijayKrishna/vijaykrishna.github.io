Interesting times at the International Conference of Automated Software Engineering this year! Delivered a research talk yesterday to present my first ever software engineering research paper! Got some great feedback and had some great interactions and good exchange of ideas with fellow researchers.

The paper and its slides that i presented can be found [here]({{ site.url }}/publications/ase13_palepu_xu_jones.pdf) and [here]({{ site.url }}/slides/ase13.pdf) respectively.

**Update:** The slides to the talk can now be accessed on SpeakerDeck.
