The purpose of this interactive narrative-based tutorial on statistical methods is to establish a simplified way for students to learn statistical concepts (specifically Hypothesis testing with t-tests) that are grounded in real-life examples. In addition to a narrative, an interface in presented that allows students to interact with data sets that are accessible on-line.

The goal is to give students interested in doing research a fun way to quickly and clearly understand critical concepts in statistics, needed to continue to experiment with their own data sets (or on-line ones) so they can interpret future data sets they work with in meaningful and statistically sound ways.

**IMPORTANT:** This project was done as a part of a class project in collaboration with Sonny Lin and Dahlia Hegab, at UC Irvine, CA.
