This is a very early prototype to assist developers, supported with visualization, to explore a program execution. This for instance would allow a developer to identify sections of the code that were executed right before a failure occurred because chances are that the fault is likely to be present in those sections (it might not be the try-catch block where the exception occurred, but probably the code that got executed before the try-catch block, that led to the exception). This alleviates the burden of manually figuring out the execution sequence, for instance using a debugger. This prototype looks at a single recorded execution of [NanoXML](http://nanoxml.sourceforge.net/orig/).

Each node in the visualization happens to be a source code line in the Java program, NanoXML. The layout of the source code, or the nodes, is guided by a force directed graph based on how the source code instructions are dependent on each other.

**IMPORTANT** Stay at the page for about 30-60 seconds for the visualization to load completely. The loading process currently suspends itself if you move away to another tab in your browser.

Also, thank you [HTML5](http://www.w3.org/html/logo/) and [D3.js](d3js.org) for killing the learning curve with developing web-applications! This was a 12-hour hack for a HTML5 newbie, which would not have been possible had the underlying technology not been so straight-forward!
