**About**

Research in Software Engineering, especially runtime or dynamic software analysis is often stymied by the inability to conduct experiments on software executions at scale, on a wide range of subject programs that vary in execution scale, input variety, complexity, and in general a whole range of different parameters that are important for meaningful scientific evalutations.
Moreoever, the complexity of harnessing executable subjects prevents evaluations to answer research questions with greater than a handful of subject programs. 
Finally, engineering advances that emerge directly as a result of scientific research are often not evaluated for their generality, because a wide range of software programs and their executions are avaliable to run such an evaluation.

Project ðŸ’¯ is about harvesting the 100 most "popular" Java, Maven-supported projects on Github that can be built and whose tests can be executed in an automated manner.
Being able to automate the builds and execution of 100 Java projects would enable scientific studies in software engineering at a unprecedented scale.

The rest of this page will detail the progress behind the collection of such projects into a harvestable suite of subject programs.
